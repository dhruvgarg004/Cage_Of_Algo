# Cage_Of_Algo
There are 3 contests given by us during the project.
The first one was on binary search, maths, and sorting. The second was on trees and the third on graphs and dynamic programming.
In each folder, there is a doc consisting of the links to the problems. The folder also consists of solutions to each problem.
